Those two demo applications are to verify basic JavaScript functionality. 
They include: to create audio, video, most HTML tags with their style. 
In jsDemo, I also added two loop methods to handle the color change and the picture movement.
In jsMedia, I added two Symbols in side bar to indicate direction so that you can easily change a video. 
There are only four video in this demo and the next of first video will be either the second or fourth one.
The last implementation is making all the elements in the center of page.

click file jsDemo.html to run one demo application. 
click other file jsMedia.html to run the other demo application.
